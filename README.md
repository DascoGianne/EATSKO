## üóÇÔ∏è About the Repository

This repository contains the code and assets for **EATSKO**, a web application developed by group one of BSIT 1-5 S.Y 2023-2024. The EATSKO application with the tagline of ‚ÄúEats Very Good!‚Äù consists of the food that is sold in the PUP Lagoon. It will categorize sweets, drinks, appetizers, rice, meals, and many more. With the consent of food stalls and vendors, the prices of the said meals will also be posted and displayed. It will also showcase the stall numbers, the location, the stall name, and the food that the user is looking for.

This application aims to help students, professors, and university staff at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines in Manila gain more knowledge about the products inside the lagoon.
